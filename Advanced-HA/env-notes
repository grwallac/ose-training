2.3. Lab objectives and Success Criteria

    Install 3 OpenShift Master nodes:
        Each Master will host a Replica of the ETCD state database.
        Masters will be accessed through a Load-balancer installed on a host residing on a public facing network.

    Install 6 nodes:
        All nodes should be available for pod deployment.
        Nodes will not be directly accessible from the public/external network.
        Nodes will be labeled in a manner conducive for an HA deployment.

    Install 2 Infranodes:
        Infranodes will reside in a public facing network and will provide access to all pods and services running on the OpenShift cluster.
        a DNS host will direct all inquiries to *.cloudapps-GUID.oselab.opentlc.com to the infranodes in a round robin method.

    Optional objective :
        Configure the IDM authentication server (idm.example.com) to serve as an authentication provider for the OpenShift Cluster.

     Success Criteria:
        Infrastructure HA - The OpenShift environment will allow deployment of Pods and services after manually shutting down a master node host.
        Application HA - Your applications (pods) will be available after shutting down 2 nodes, and an infranode at random.
